On May 17, the CCID Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially released the first global public-block chain technology evaluation index and ranking. The results show that the typical representative of the second-generation blockchain technology is Ethereum's technology assessment index with a smart contract function of 129.4, ranking first in the assessment list. The following  blockchains are ranked second to fifth and they are Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo. Bitcoin, which has received much attention from the industry, ranks only 13th.



The evaluation of the global public-block chain technology mainly focuses on the basic technical level, application level and innovation ability of the public chain. In terms of sub-indexes, the Steem chain that utilizes the blockchain graphene architecture has the highest score in the basic technical indicators. The NEO whose goal is to use smart contracts to automate the management of digital assets is ranked first in application assessment. The first place in the innovation power index is Bitcoin, which pioneered the application of blockchain technology.



Although China ranks first among global blockchain-related patent applications, it can be seen from the evaluation results of public-chain technology that China is still lagging behind in this area of technological innovation. Only NEO is among the top ranked public-chain projects. Quantum chains are dominated by domestic technology teams.



It is reported that the index released this time is the world's first technology-focused public chain assessment index, which will be issued periodically on a monthly basis. The issuance of this index will help to fully grasp the status of global public-chain technology development, regularly track the direction of public-chain technology innovation, and help promote the innovation and application of blockchain technology.
