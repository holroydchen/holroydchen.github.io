My child has been eating shit food with me for days. I feel so sorry for her. Today I decided to cook something good for her.  After doing some investigation, a crab noodle might be an excellent meal for her. During lunch time, I went to purchase two blue crabs, a bunch of spring onion and a piece of ginger, a bag of instant noodle. It is quite easy to cook delicious crab noodle, just follow these steps.

好几天跟娃娃一起吃了很多我闻着就想吐的食物，我深感内疚，决定给她做点好吃的。做啥呢，思来想去，灵光一动，最螃蟹炒面吧。查了些资料，中午去维妈市场采购了两只蓝蟹，一捆葱，一个姜。接下来步骤还是很简单的。

Step one: cook a pot of water until it boils. 

第一步， 烧一锅开水。

Step two: place amount of noodle into the boiling water and wait for 4 minutes, be aware not to fully cook it, get the noodle out and merge into clean cool water, drag the noodle out and put in a plate.

第二步，把面放到锅里煮四分钟，注意别煮透了，然后捞起来，放干净的冷水过滤下，捞起来备用。

Step three: dismantle the crabs, tear off its limbs, open its cover, cut it in halves. Be aware to throw away those white stripes since they are crab's lungs.

第三步，螃蟹洗干净，分离壳、腿、从身子中间对半切。壳可以留下装饰用。记得把螃蟹的肺去掉，寒气重。

第四步，把葱和姜切碎。

Step five: pour some oil into the pot and place crabs, spring onion, ginger to  fry and stir for five minutes. Then pour in a little cooking wine and cover for half a minute.

第五步，锅内放少许油，放入葱、姜、蟹炒香，加入料酒立马盖盖闷半分钟。

Step six: put some light soy sauce，water  to the crabs and cover for 2 minutes, until they are fully served, then get all out including the crab soup.

第六步，加入生抽、少量水、还有螃蟹壳再闷2分钟左右，等螃蟹熟透和剩余少量汤汁一起盛出来。


Step seven: no need to clean the pot, using small fire to warm the pot, put a little oil, put noodle in, spray some spring onion and stir them up.

第七步，面条提前控水，不需清洗锅，直接小火加入一点点油、放入葱、面条拌一下。


Step eight: pour the crab mixture to the pot and mix evenly with the noodle. A pot of delicious crab noddle is now ready for serve!!


第八步，把螃蟹和少量剩余汤汁倒入，拌匀。起锅。
