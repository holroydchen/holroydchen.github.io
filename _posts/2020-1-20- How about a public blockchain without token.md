I am thinking these days, what will a blockchain be without token?  how about if we remove tokens from public blockchain, just as what the hyper-ledger is doing.  Technically, token is not mandatory to a blockchain.  As we know, token is used for the reward of witness, who is responsible to confirm each transaction in the block chain, broadcast transactions to other nodes to sync database.  Witness rents servers,  leases broadband, installs witness software,  hires employees to do maintenance job,  pays for the electricity bills. Without incentive tokens, who would be volunteers to do such jobs for years? Regarding private chain and Alliance chain,  they do not need tokens to stimulate, since they have other ways to compensate for witness jobs.





The design of blockchain is to overcome human being's weak nature. e.g. trust and greedy. Driven by interest, people have motivations to struggle for the job to mine,  driven by money, more and more people are pouring to steemit to write, to develop more and more tools, thus make steemit not only a simple community forum or blog platform, but also a  content publish eco-system.  Chinese government banned ICO, it is predictable that there won't be much stimulus among Chinese people to develop block chain technology, unless government would like to invest a large of amount of money in this area, which is unbelievable with  current polity.   We must admit that almost 99% of the ICO projects are scam, however, there are still some difference.  Some people took the initiative to be scam in the first place, which means they knew their project won't be implemented from the beginning and their only purpose was to cheat money!   There is another group of people, who really wanted to achieve something, they cherish  a wonderful dream to realize their blockchain products. However, they failed at the end, thus all the investors lost their money.  We should distinguish this group of people from the former.  I understand why the Chinese government would totally ban ICO in China,  because China has a vast territory and a large amount of population, which means there are TOO MANY RIP-OFFS!   This is also the reason  why cheaters like to play in America as well.





In summary,  public blockchain must be supported by cryptocurrency.  I wish we can find a decentralized way to supervise these distributed blockchain systems. My advice for every investors not easily believe the propaganda, but do research in the existing system. An ICO project should at least have a prototype which can  show up how it works, The greater the publicity, the greater the possibility of a liar!



最近我一直在想，如果把区块链公链中的代币去掉，比如超级账本的做法，那会怎么样？技术上说，区块链应该完全不需要代币。我们知道，区块链中数字货币最初的作用是奖励矿工的，矿工的作用就是把网络中的交易进行打包确认，广播到网络中，让每个参与的节点同步数据库，矿工要自己租机器，租带宽，安装矿工软件，雇人维护设备，耗费电力去对每个交易进行确认，对于工作量证明的共识机制，还要努力算哈希值。如果没有经济利益的补偿，没有奖励，那么谁会去志愿长年累月做这个事情呢？当然，对于联盟链和私有链，他们有私下里利益分配，不需要数字货币来激励。



区块链的设计就是探讨克服人性的各种弱点，比如彼此信任问题，比如人性的贪婪，在利益驱动下，可以激发内在的活力去争取努力挖矿，比如steemit吸引越来越多人来写文章，在公有链里，人们在利益驱动下，才能把区块链做大做强。所以我 认为中国政府把ICO禁止了，那么民间就不可能真的有资本力量去做大区块链了，的确，ICO项目99%是骗子 ，这个骗子是主动的或者被动的，主动的，那么从项目设计开始，目的就是割韭菜，圈钱；被动的，创始者初衷可能是想做一个项目，但是结果失败了，这也是无可奈何的事情。但是中国太大，贪婪之人太多，在监管手段不成熟前提下，只能一刀切，这点我还是理解政府的做法。但是这样做的副作用就是，区块链技术在中国不大可能有大的发展了。





区块链公链必须有货币支持，希望未来有一天，大家能想到一个方法用去中心化的监管方式来对待这个去中心化系统。对于每一个参与投资的人来说，希望大家不要轻易相信宣传，而是要眼见为实，起码要有个可运行的原型存在，宣传越大，骗子的可能性越大！
