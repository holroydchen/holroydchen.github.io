These are share prices trend for three different companies：  Microsoft, IBM and Yahoo.  These companies are selected because they were .Net in  year 2000 and they do survive and become success. However, do investors achieve success as well? 


这是三家不同的互联网公司：微软，I B M和雅虎。我选它们做样本，是因为它们在2000年时候是带着.Net 属性的公司，并且存活下来，取得了成功。但是，在这漫长的岁月里，投资者成功了吗？

During these 17 years, internet evoluted from concept to solid usage. However,  those survivals took longer than people imaged to digest the bubble price and investors suffered a lot.  The peak prices in 2000 have never been exceeded in subsequent so many years!!!

在这17年中，互联网从概念变成实实在在的应用。但是这些存活下来的公司花了人们始料不及的时间来消化它们的泡沫股价，投资者受尽煎熬。在2000年高点的股价居然接下来那么多年都没有被突破！！
