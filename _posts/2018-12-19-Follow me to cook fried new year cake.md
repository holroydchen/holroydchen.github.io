It is very easy to cook fried new year cake.  You need to buy it from some Chinese shop. You need to buy some Chinese carbage. The meat slice is optional.   


做炒年糕是相当简单的事情。 首先，去当地华人店买一袋年糕，再买些青菜。肉丝可选。


Preparation: You'd better soak the new year cake in water for half an hour to make them soft.  

准备工作：把年糕放水里先浸泡半个小时使它们软一些。

Clean the Chinese carbage and cut them into pieces.  Put them into an oiled pan to stir and fry.  Spread some salt. 


把青菜洗干净，切成碎片。把它们放油锅里炒。撒些盐。

Pour the new year cakes into the Chinese carbage and stir them together. Put some water to fry and stir the new year cakes to soften them.  Spread some salt again, make sure it won't salty and just right.  After 15 minutes all done and ready for serve. 

把年糕放青菜里一起炒，边炒边翻腾，使年糕变软。撒些水，撒些盐，注意不要太咸。大概15分钟后一切就绪。

So easy, vegetarian and healthy, isn't it? 

就是这么简单，素食健康，不是吗？
