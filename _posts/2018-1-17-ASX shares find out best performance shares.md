In this post, I am going to pick up those companies whose share price increased at least 10%. I will figured out the percentage of these companies in their own industries. 

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
`import pandas as pd`
`import csv`
`import numpy as np`

`def DrawBar(df,title_msg):`
    `plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))`
    `label = df['industry']`
    `cmpcount = df['Company Count']`
    `index = np.arange(len(label))`
    plt.bar(index, cmpcount,0.35)
    plt.xlabel('Industry', fontsize=20)
    plt.ylabel('Number of Companies', fontsize=20)
    plt.xticks(index, label, fontsize=20, rotation=90)
    `plt.title(title_msg)`
    `plt.show()`
    
​    
`def DrawPie(slice_list,labels,colors,title_msg):`
    plt.style.use('ggplot')
    plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))
    #explode = (0,0.05,0.08,0.10,0,0,0)
    plt.pie(slice_list,
        #explode=explode,
        labels=labels,colors=colors,
        labeldistance = 1.15,autopct = '%3.1f%%',shadow = False,
        startangle = 90,pctdistance = 0.6,counterclock = False)
    plt.axis('equal')
    plt.title(title_msg,y = 1.08)
    plt.show()


​    

`dataFile = './shares_likely_jump_cashburn_filter.csv'`
`df =pd.read_csv(dataFile,header=0,index_col=0)`
`df.rename(columns={"Asx Code.1": "Asx Code"},inplace=True)`
`print(df.columns)`

`df_category = df.groupby('industry').agg({'Company Name':'count'}).rename(columns={'Company Name':'Company Count'}).reset_index()`
`print('all shares is',df.shape[0])`
`print(df_category[df_category['industry']=='Banks'])`

`df10 = df[(df['pricediff']>=10)]`

`df0_neg20 = df[(df['pricediff']<=-20)]`

`df10_group = df10.groupby('industry').agg({'Company Name':'count'}).rename(columns={'Company Name':'Company Count'}).reset_index()`


`df_merged = pd.merge(df10_group, df_category, how='inner', on=['industry'])`

`df_merged['Company Count'] = df_merged['Company Count_x']/df_merged['Company Count_y']*100`

`df_merged.drop(['Company Count_x', 'Company Count_y'], axis=1,inplace=True)`

`print(df_merged)`


"""
We are going to draw bar chart to indicate  percentage of companies with outstanding price changes in the industries.
"""

`DrawBar(df_merged,'The Distribution of Companies ( percentage in their own industries) with Share Price climing more than 10% in the next Year')`



This is all those industries and the percentage of companies in these area:

We can see there are two industries in which all companies inside had good share price performance, let's see who they are and their price trend in the market:

`df10[df['industry']=='Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment']`

| Asx Code | Company Name       | Finacial Year | Revenue Increase % | industry                                 | pricediff |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
