Among all the food, I am expert at making dumplings. My child is very fussy about food, however, I can proudly  say she likes dumplings I made!



To make dumplings by yourself is an easy but cheerful thing.  Just follow me step by step and you can achieve it.  Today I am going to tutor you how to make chive-port dumplings.  My recipe can make up to 48X3 dumplings.



Firstly, we need a shopping list:

1. a bunch of chives from any Chinese shop;
2. dumpling skins from any Chinese shop, remember the brand in my photo, other skins might be too thick, 1kg of dumpling skins can make 48X2 dumplings; I bought 1.5 kg so I can make 48X3 dumplings;
3. pork mince: 1kg ;
4. a box of eggs;
5. prawns: 6 or so;
6. tablet salt ( mostly this is ready in your kitchen);
