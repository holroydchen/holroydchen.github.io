As an individual investor in Australia stock market who want to establish your own trading system, one of the most important input is market data. However, market data is not cheap, and market data vendors' clients are mostly those institutes and fund managers.  Their data is too fine for most individual investors and most people don't like to pay so much for things overqualified.  There are ways to get some data for free which are public for private research.  I will describe how to use some technology to download those data and format it in .csv which is wide used by many people. This is an outline.
