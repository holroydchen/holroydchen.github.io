My home computer is Chinese languaged based windows system and my child cannot understand.  It is required to install a  linux  and English based system similiar to the school in my computer.  I don't want to switch from one system to another so I need to install the linux system in a VM. 

I once installed ubuntu 16.4 in my office PC using hyper-V as the virtual machine, the speed is acceptable and it is quite stable. However the office PC is windows 10.  My home PC is windows 7 and hyper-V cannot work in a workstation , it should work in a server or connect to a server, thus I cannot use hyper-V in windows 7.

I tried oracle virtual Box  as VM with ubuntu 17,  it is  fragile and reported memory broken several times,  failed.
Then I tried the same VM with 16.4, this time it is better,  however, it still threw out exception.

Finally I tried VM ware with ubuntu 16.4, this proved to be quite stable.

Updated 2017/9/2:  VM ware with ubuntu 16.4 is too slow and unacceptable, I tried with Apple Mac os x 10.10 today and it is much better. 

There are many bloggers who made comparsion between different virual machine softwares without really experience them. So be cautious about them.
